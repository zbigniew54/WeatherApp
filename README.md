# React Weather App
This is a simple app I made during [React](https://react.dev/)/[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) course at [Coders Lab](https://coderslab.pl/pl). It fetches weather data from [The Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/). You can press "Add City" and search for any city in the world. The app displays widget for each location with its current weather and a prediction for the next 3 days.
